## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

**Describe:**

* The Algorithmic Justice League is an organization that helps combat social implications and the harms of artificial intelligence. Their mission is to make people aware of the impacts of AI and build the voice of the most imacted communities. AI has been a part in healthcare, but many challenges still persist in regards to accurate predictions and fair representation of communities. AI can perform poorer for people with dark skintones because of a lack of diverse datasets. The goal of this competition is to bridge that gap by using a divserse dataset to classify differennt skin conditions on different colored skins.  
* The objective of the challenge is to train a model that can classify 21 different skin conditions. We have been given datasets with numerous images that depict various skin conditions. These datasets have a diverse set of skintones to maintain a fair representation of skin conditions. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict different skin conditions. Our model will be evaluated with a separate testing dataset and will be scored based on a weighted average F1 score metric. 
* This project will address a major problem with using AI in healthcare. Often times, a lack of fair representation in datasets create biased models. These models can result in inaccurate predictions for skin conditions in patients. Our goal is to bridge the gap by creating a model that can predict different skin conditions by using a diverse dataset. This is significant as it will reduce bias and make AI more reliable in healthcare.
